    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>I started my career in the finance sector, working as a Senior Associate, where I developed a deep understanding of financial workflows and operations. Over time, I realized my passion lies not in the execution of finance itself, but in building better tools and systems for it. This led me to pursue a Product Management course, through which I transitioned my thinking into solving user problems, building efficient solutions, and working cross-functionally to bring ideas to life. My focus is now on the FinTech space, where I can blend my finance experience with product thinking to deliver real impact.</p>
